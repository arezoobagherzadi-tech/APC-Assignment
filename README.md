# APC-Assignment
This project is the mobile test automation for ClevCalc app on Android platform.
This is a maven project based on page object model design pattern that contains element classes for each page and action class and the class for test cases then you can find test scenario classes that is using test cases methods.

You can run the TestScenarios class (APC Assessment/src/test/java/TestScenarios.java) to run all the test cases sequentially or you can run each test case individually.
In TestScenarios class and openCalculator method, I set device capabilities. You need to change "deviceName", "udid" and "platformVersion" based on your test device.
